    <h1>Formatting options</h1>
    <p>The Bot API supports basic formatting for messages. You can use bold, italic, underlined and strikethrough text, as well as inline links and pre-formatted code in your bots' messages. Telegram clients will render them accordingly. You can use either markdown-style or HTML-style formatting</p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Note that Telegram clients will display an alert to the user before opening an inline link ('<a href="http://">Open this link?'</a>  together with the full URL).
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>Message entities can be nested, providing following restrictions are met:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If two entities has common characters then one of them is fully contained inside another.
        </li>
        <li>bold, italic, underline and strikethrough entities can contain and to be contained in any other entities, except pre and code.
        </li>
        <li> All other entities can't contain each other.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Links tg://user?id=<user_id> can be used to mention a user by their ID without using a username. Please note:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>These links will work only if they are used inside an inline link. For example, they will not work, when used in an inline keyboard button or in a message text.</li>
        <li>These mentions are only guaranteed to work if the user has contacted the bot in the past, has sent a callback query to the bot via inline button or is a member in the group where he was mentioned.
        </li>
    </ol>
